statement: "I like my paintings to evoke the idea of the passing of time through subtle suggestions of movement. For instance, when I paint a tree I would like you to imagine the branches dancing in the wind, just as I see them in my mind. Perhaps when you look at a gnarled tree trunk in my paintings you might think of the evolving beauty of its enduring life span. It is all about having more than just two or even three dimensions in a two-dimensional work."
